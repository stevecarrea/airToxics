# Toxic Release Inventory

The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a publicly available database containing information on toxic chemical releases and other waste management activities in the United States. The data is collected and made available by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and includes information reported annually by industry that produce more than 25,000 pounds or handle more than 10,000 pounds of a listed toxic chemical. Congress enacted this program under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA).
